# Password Cracking & Strength Analysis Tool

 This project simulates various password cracking techniques to provide a realistic assessment of password security.
 Unlike conventional password checkers, which only evaluate password complexity based on rules, this tool tests passwords against real-world cracking methods, offering practical insights into password strength.

## Features

### Multi-Method Cracking Simulation
- Dictionary Attack
- Brute Force Attack
- Hybrid Attack (e.g., common words combined with numbers)

### Scoring System
- Passwords are evaluated based on their resistance to different cracking methods, and a strength score is assigned.

### Detailed Feedback
- Time to crack for each method
- Recommendations for improving password strength

### How it works 

## Installation 
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <link>
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the tool:
```bash
python password_analysis.py
```
